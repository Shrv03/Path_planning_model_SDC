# Path_planning_model_SDC
This repository contains a sample path planning pipeline for autonomous vehicles built for Google Colab.

## Colab Usage

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   !git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Open `path_planning_example.ipynb` and follow the cells step by step.
   The notebook shows how to generate a simple grid map, run an A* path planning algorithm, and visualize the resulting path.

The code can run entirely on the free Colab CPU environment.
